		<p> When I look at these awards, there was a time when I could only dream of achieveing these. Over a decade ago is where it all started. I had low self esteem, low confidence, I was bullied, diganosed with physical and mental medical issues, and very few believed in my educational and athletic abitlities. Although many regret or have seen me thrive, I can't blame them for not believeing at the time. I did not care about school that much, was physically challenged due to my height and small frame, and I always had somekind of setback that I have to overcome (whether it was by fate or self infliction. But through it all I was able to pursue many awards, choose a great major to study for a great career, and live my life the way I have envisioned it so far. There will be many more challenges, but I will be ready for them all. Is it really a testimony if there are no test????
